# Problem Statement

The goal of this challenge is to train models which can look at images of food items and detect the individual food items present in them.
We provide a novel dataset of food images collected using the MyFoodRepo project where numerous volunteer Swiss users provide images of their daily food intake. The images have been hand labelled by a group of experts to map the individual food items to an ontology of Swiss Food items.

This is an evolving dataset, where we will release more data as the dataset grows in size.

# Baseline

MMdetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch, with a large Model Zoo with many customised models that can be plugged and tested in with just a single config file modification.
